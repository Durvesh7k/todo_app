# Todo App

This is a simple Todo app built with React Native. It allows you to create and manage your tasks in a convenient and organized manner. Currently It is not connected to the backend I am working on that part.

## Features

- Add new tasks with a title and optional description.
- Mark tasks as completed or incomplete.
- Delete tasks that are no longer needed.
- View a list of all tasks with their current status.
